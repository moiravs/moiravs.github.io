# Background



In the discrete geometric setting, we consider a geometric graph, where a shortcut connects two vertices. Große et al. are the first to consider diameter minimization in this setting. They determine a shortcut that minimizes the discrete diameter of a path with n vertices in $O(n log^3 n)$ time <a href="#ulrike"> [2]</a>.

In the continuous setting, for path networks, an algorithm to determine an optimal shortcut in linear time has already been developped by De Carufel et al. <a href="#carufel"> [3]</a>. De Carufel
et al.<a href="#grimm"> [4]</a>  also studied trees and presents an algorithm to find an optimal shortcut for a tree of size n in O(n log n) time.
