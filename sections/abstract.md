# Abstract

The goal of the paper <i>Computing optimal shortcuts for networks </i><a href="#originalpaper"> [1]</a> is to determine a segment that minimizes the distance between any two points of the network.
<br></br>
It focuses on a continuous setting, where all points in the network, not just the vertices, must be taken into account when computing and placing a shortcut. A polynomial time algorithm is introduced for this setting, and a discrete version of the problem, paired with an approximation algorithm, are introduced too.

It also introduces a polynomial time algorithm to compute the diameter for path networks, a subset of general networks, as well as a better algorithm to find the optimal simple shortcut (that don't cross the network) and the optimal horizontal shortcut.

This work has a lot of practical applications, particularly in road design network, for example to decide a new subway track that diminishes the maximum travel time.
